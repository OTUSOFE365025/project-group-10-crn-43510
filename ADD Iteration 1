# ADD Iteration 1: Establishing System Foundation

## Step 1: Review Inputs
**Design Purpose:** 
- Establish the overall system structure for AIDAP (AI Digital Assistant Platform)
- Focus on high-level architectural decisions

**Primary Functional Requirements:**
- UC-1: Student AI Assistant
- UC-3: Personalized Student Dashboard
- UC-2: Notifications

**Quality Attribute Scenarios:**
- Performance: System must respond to student queries within 2 seconds
- Availability: System must maintain 99.5% uptime during academic terms
- Security: User authentication and data protection must meet university standards

**Constraints:**
- Must integrate with existing university systems (student information system, learning management system)
- Must support 10,000+ concurrent users
- Cloud-based deployment required

**Architectural Concerns:**
- Scalability for growing user base
- Integration with external AI services
- Data privacy and compliance

## Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal
**Goal:** 
Design the high-level architecture to support core student-facing functionality (AI assistant, dashboard, notifications) while ensuring performance, availability, and security requirements are met.

**Focus Areas:**
- Overall system structure
- Major subsystems and their interactions
- Technology stack selection
- Deployment strategy

## Step 3: Choose Elements to Refine
**Elements Selected:**
- Entire AIDAP system (greenfield design)
- Focus on student-facing modules first
- Core AI integration layer

## Step 4: Choose Design Concepts

### Reference Architecture: Microservices Architecture with Three-Tier Layering

**Reference Architecture Selected:** Microservices-based Three-Tier Architecture

**Justification:**
The microservices architecture pattern is chosen as the primary reference architecture for AIDAP based on the following requirements analysis:
- Need for independent scaling of services (R7: cloud-native, scalable service)
- Integration with multiple external systems (R3: LMS, registration, calendars)
- Support for 5,000+ concurrent users (RA7)
- High availability requirements (RS11: 99.5% uptime)
- Need for independent deployment and updates (RM1: zero-downtime deployment)

Within each microservice, we apply the three-tier pattern (Presentation, Business Logic, Data) for internal organization.

**Reference:** This follows the microservices architecture pattern as described in "Building Microservices" by Sam Newman and the three-tier pattern from "Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture" (POSA).

### Architectural Pattern Details

**Tier 1: Presentation Layer**
- Handles user interaction for web, mobile, and voice interfaces
- Components: Student Interface, Lecturer Interface, Admin Interface, Maintainer Interface

**Tier 2: Business Logic Layer (Microservices)**
- Independent services with specific responsibilities
- Components: Authentication Service, AI Assistant Service, Dashboard Service, Notification Service, User Management Service

**Tier 3: Data Layer**
- Persistent storage and caching
- Components: PostgreSQL (structured data), MongoDB (conversation history), Redis (caching)

### Technology Decisions

**Frontend Technologies:**
- React.js for responsive web interface
- React Native for mobile applications
- Voice SDK integration for voice assistants

**Backend Technologies:**
- Node.js with Express framework for API services
- Microservices communicate via RESTful APIs
- Message queue (RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication

**Data Storage:**
- PostgreSQL for relational data (users, courses, schedules, grades)
- MongoDB for unstructured data (conversation history, logs, analytics)
- Redis for session management and caching

**AI Integration:**
- OpenAI API for natural language processing (R5: AI models for NL queries)
- Custom intent classification for AIDAP-specific queries

**Authentication:**
- OAuth 2.0 with university SSO integration (RS7)
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication

**Cloud Infrastructure:**
- AWS for cloud hosting (R7: cloud-native deployment)
- Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Docker for containerization

**Justification for Technology Stack:**
- **React/React Native:** Unified codebase for web and mobile (RS9: mobile, web, voice)
- **Node.js:** JavaScript full-stack reduces context switching, excellent for I/O-heavy operations
- **Microservices:** Independent scaling and deployment aligns with university's need for high availability
- **PostgreSQL:** ACID compliance needed for academic data integrity (RD4)
- **MongoDB:** Flexible schema for conversation history (R2: store historical interactions)
- **Redis:** In-memory caching achieves 2-second response requirement (RS10)
- **OpenAI API:** Proven NLP capabilities without building AI from scratch (R5)
- **AWS + Kubernetes:** Industry-standard cloud-native deployment for scalability (R7, RA7)
